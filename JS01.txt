12. Operation on Numbers - 2 15/01/2024 to 16/01/2024
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the name N, and another number stored in a variable with the name M

You have to perform the following operations on the value stored in N:

1. Multiply the value stored in N by 40
2. Add 20 to the value stored in N
3. Subtract 50 from the value stored in N

You are given another number stored in the variable M

If the value after performing the above operations is greater than M, print Greater!, else if the value is equal, print Equal!, else print Lesser!

For example, consider the value stored in N = 5, and the value stored in M = 10

Then, after performing the above operations, the value stored in N becomes:

     N = N * 40 = 200

     N = N + 20 = 220

     N = N - 50 = 170
Now, the value stored in M is 10, which is lesser than the value stored in N. Therefore, the output is Greater!

Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in N and M

Output
Print the output according to the condition shown in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 

5 10
Sample Output 1

Greater!
Hint

In the sample test case, consider the value stored in N = 5, and the value stored in M = 10

Then, after performing the above operation, the value stored in N becomes:

     N = N * 40 = 200

     N = N + 20 = 220

     N = N - 50 = 170
Now, the value stored in M is 10, which is lesser than the value stored in N. Therefore, the output is Greater!

Sample Input 1 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 1

132
Hint

The value of A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5, F = 6, G = 7. Therefore, the sum of (A + B + C) is 6, and that of (D + E + F + G) is 22. Therefore, the product of (A + B + C) and that of (D + E + F + G) is equal to 6 x 22 = 132

Sample Output 1

48
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5, six = 6

After updating the values, the values stored become one = 1, two = 4, three = 9, four = 12, five = 10, six = 12

Adding the updated values the sum becomes 1 + 4 + 9 + 12 + 10 + 12 = 48, which is the required answer

16. Update & Compare 15/01/2024 to 16/01/2024
Description

You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the names num1 and num2

Print the output of the following operation

num1 > num2, this prints true if num1 is greater than num2, else it prints false
After this operation is performed, another number, stored in a variable with name num3 is added to num1. After this, print the result of the following operation again

num1 > num2, this prints true if num1 is greater than num2, else it prints false

Input
The first and the only line of input contains the values stored in num1, num2, and num3

Output
Print the result of the operations given in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 

4 8 5
Sample Output 1

false
true
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in num1 = 4, while the value stored in num2 = 8. The result of the operation

 num1 > num2, such that 4 is not greater than 8, so the output is false
After this step, the value stored in num3 = 5, is added to num1, so the value stored in num1 becomes num1 = num1 + num3 = 4 + 5 = 9

Therefore, the result of the operation

num1 > num2, such that 9 is greater than 8, is true, so the output is true the second time

2. num1 < num2 -> this operations prints true if num1 is smaller than num2, otherwise it prints false
3. num1 == num2 -> this operation print true if num1 is equal to num2, otherwise it prints false
You have to print the result of three operations in the order as shown above

Input
The first and the only line of input contains the values stored in num1 and num2

Output
Print the result of three operations, one by one, on a new line

Sample Input 1 

4 16 
Sample Output 1

false
true
false
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in num1 = 4 and value stored in num2 = 16

In the first operation num1 > num2, 4 is not greater than 16, so we get the output as false

In the second operation num1 < num2, 4 is lesser than 16, so we get the output as true

In the third operation num1 == num2, num1 is not equal to num2, so we get the output as false

Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in the variables is as follows:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5, f = 6, g = 7

The value of sum1, as explained in the problem statement will be, sum1 = (a + b) * c = (1 + 2) * 3 = (3) * 3 = 9

Similarly, the value of sum2, as explained in the problem statement will be sum2 = (d + e + f + g) = (4 + 5 + 6 + 7) = 22

The operation sum1 > sum2 will print false, as the value of sum2 is greater than sum1, hence the output is false
